stock market prediction tools, in the near future I am going to update this. The purpose is making prediction mobile application

- S&P500 from 1950 to 2019 year.
- analazy market risk, based on prediction we can decided to go in or not.
- correlesion analysis
- heat maps to visualize the correlation ranges among the competing stocks
- Stocks Returns Rate and Risk

# Linear regression
# Quadratic Regression 2
# Quadratic Regression 3
# KNN regression
# Using neural networks with 1D convolutional and LSTM layers
The last method we'll use is a neural network based one using Keras / Tensorflow. We use a stack of Conv1D and LSTM layers, followed by Dense layers lastly followed by a linear layer to predict the stock price.
