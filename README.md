stock market prediction tools

in this case S&P500 from 1950 to 2019 year.


# Linear regression
# Quadratic Regression 2
# Quadratic Regression 3
#KNN regression
# Using neural networks with 1D convolutional and LSTM layers
The last method we'll use is a neural network based one using Keras / Tensorflow. We use a stack of Conv1D and LSTM layers, followed by Dense layers lastly followed by a linear layer to predict the stock price.
